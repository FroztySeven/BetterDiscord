## nativeTitlebarSeven (Auto update system)
Credits to [internl](https://github.com/intrnl) for creating the original nativeTitleBar addon

The Original nativeTitlebar can be found [here](https://github.com/intrnl/discordAdditions/tree/master/nativeTitlebar)

This is an edit by me which has a new discord logo to the right side, smaller caption buttons.

###### Features
- Caption button tooltips coded by [internl](https://github.com/intrnl)
- New discord logo for the right side
- Less spaced caption buttons
- Works best with the Beard Material theme by [BeardDesign](https://github.com/BeardDesign1/Material-design-theme)
